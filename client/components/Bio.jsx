        Hi, my name is Kevin and I am a software engineer/musician. I graduated
        from Fullstack Academy's Flex Web Development program in July of 2021.
        Before Fullstack Academy, I took various courses offered on Udemy and
        Codecademy, both sites I still use to this day. I always enjoy the
        process of learning something new and challenging, things that software
        engineering has no shortage of. Check out my resume below for my work
        history and/or navigate to the code tab above to check out some projects
        I've created. Thanks for checking out my site and I hope to hear from
        you soon!
